<!-- AGENT-BRAIN TEMPLATE — domain summary (L2) BUDGET: 150 lines HARD.

This is the highest-value document type in Agent-Brain. L1 exists in every repo. L3 and L4 exist in every repo. THIS layer is what
is missing, and its absence is why agents read code to answer questions code was never the right source for.

THE TEST: could an agent implement a small feature in this domain, correctly, having read only this document and the files it names?
If not, this describes the domain rather than enabling work in it.

`sources:` is mandatory — it is what makes drift mechanically detectable. `excludes:` is mandatory — an agent that knows this
document's boundary stops trusting it at the right place; one that does not will answer out of a gap.

# {{Domain Name}}

## Purpose

{{TWO_TO_THREE_SENTENCES: what this capability does for the business. Business language, not implementation language.}}

## Key concepts

<!-- The vocabulary needed to read this domain's code correctly. Words that mean something specific here. -->

| Term | Means |
|---|---|
| {{Invoice}} | {{A finalized, immutable charge record. Distinct from a Draft.}} |

## Where the code lives

| What | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Entrypoint | `{{src/billing/index.ts}}` | {{start here}} |
| Core logic | `{{src/billing/service.ts}}` | |
| Data models | `{{src/billing/models/}}` | |
| Tests | `{{src/billing/__tests__/}}` | |

## How it works

<!-- The main flow, compressed. NOT a code walkthrough — name the steps and the files, and let the agent go to source when it needs
to. -->

1. {{Step — `file.ts`}}
2. {{Step — `file.ts`}}
3. {{Step — `file.ts`}}

## Integration points

| Direction | With | Via |
|---|---|---|
| Depends on | {{domain.auth}} | {{session token}} |
| Depended on by | {{domain.orders}} | {{`createInvoice()`}} |
| External | {{Stripe}} | {{webhooks + REST}} |

## Constraints & gotchas

<!-- THE HIGHEST-VALUE SECTION. The things that cause incidents. Write what you would tell a new engineer on their first day in this
code. -->

- {{e.g. All amounts are integer cents. A float here has caused two incidents.}}
- {{e.g. Webhooks are at-least-once — every handler must be idempotent.}}

## Not covered here

<!-- Mandatory. Mirror `excludes:` frontmatter, with pointers. -->

- {{Tax calculation → `.brain/domains/tax.md`}}
- {{Payouts to providers → `.brain/domains/payouts.md`}}

## Unverified

<!-- Anything inferred from structure rather than confirmed in code. Keeping this honest is what lets a reader know which claims to
re-check. Delete the section if everything here was verified. -->

- {{Inferred from directory naming; not confirmed against code.}}
